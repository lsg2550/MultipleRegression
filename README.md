The goal of this research is coming up with a program that takes different data as input and outputs all possible maximum size linear multiple regression functions. 
These functions must consist only of relevant variables, and the degree of multicollinearity in each function cannot be too high. This “pre-processing procedure” 
can help detect relations among different variables, apart from greatly reducing the computation time and space for later backward elimination procedures.
